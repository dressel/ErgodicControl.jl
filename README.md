# ErgodicControl

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dressel/ErgodicControl.jl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dressel/ErgodicControl.jl)

This package currently generates ergodic trajectories for dynamical systems.
Currently, the distributions with with ergodicity can be measured must be either in R^2 or SE(2).

In the future, I will add additional dimensions.

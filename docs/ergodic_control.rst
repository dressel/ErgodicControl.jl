Ergodic Control Overview
==========================

Brief overview of ergodic control gathering.


Ergodicity
===========
A trajectory is ergodic with respect to a distribution if its time-averaged statistics match the distribution's spatial statistics. 
In an ergodic trajectory, the time spent in a region is proportional to the distribution's density in the region.
If we have some domain :math:`X`, we denote the distribution :math:`\phi`, and :math:`\phi(x)` describes the density at :math:`\x\in X`.

.. math::
    x + x = 17

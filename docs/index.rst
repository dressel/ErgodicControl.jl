ErgodicControl.jl - Design of Ergodic Trajectories
=====================================================

ErgodicControl.jl is a Julia package for performing ergodic control---that is, designing trajectories that are ergodic with respect to some spatial distribution.

This code only generates discrete ergodic trajectories.

As of Feb 22, 2017, this code is still under development. Things I need to add include variational integration and an extension to SE(2).
